      <h1>Create Your Redirect Link</h1>

      <p>Welcome to Brandon's Redirects! This page will guide you through the process of creating your own redirect link.</p>

      <h2>Step 1: Choose a URL Path</h2>

      <p>The first step is to choose a unique path for your redirect link. This path will be added to the end of the URL <code>https://url.blueboy.cf/</code>. For example, if you choose the path <code>mylink</code>, your redirect link will be <code>https://url.blueboy.cf/mylink</code>.</p>

      <p>Make sure to choose a path that is easy to remember and relates to the destination you want to redirect to.</p>

      <h2>Step 2: Create an Issue on GitHub</h2>

      <p>Once you have chosen a path for your redirect link, you need to create an issue on GitHub with the same title as your chosen path. The description of the issue should contain the URL you want to redirect to.</p>

      <p>Visit the <a href="https://github.com/BlueBots/url/issues">GitHub issues page</a> for this project and click on the "New issue" button to create a new issue. Set the title of the issue to your chosen path and add the destination URL in the description. Then, click "Submit new issue" to create the issue.</p>

      <h2>Step 3: Test Your Redirect Link</h2>

      <p>After creating the issue on GitHub, wait for a few moments to allow the system to update. Then, you can test your redirect link by visiting <code>https://url.blueboy.cf/your-chosen-path</code> in a web browser. It should automatically redirect you to the destination URL you specified in the issue description.</p>

      <p>Congratulations! You have successfully created your own redirect link.</p>

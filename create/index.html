      <h1>Create Your Redirect Link</h1>

      <p>Welcome to Brandon's Redirects! This page will guide you through the process of creating your own redirect link.</p>
	
      <h2>Step 1: Choose a URL Path</h2>

      <p>The first step is to choose a unique path for your redirect link. This path will be added to the end of the URL <code>https://url.blueboy.cf/</code>. For example, if you choose the path <code>mylink</code>, your redirect link will be <code>https://url.blueboy.cf/mylink</code>.</p>

      <p>Make sure to choose a path that is easy to remember and relates to the destination you want to redirect to.</p>

      <h2>Step 2: Create an Issue on GitHub</h2>

      <p>Once you have chosen a path for your redirect link, you need to create an issue on GitHub with the same title as your chosen path. The description of the issue should contain the URL you want to redirect to.</p>

		<p><b>Make sure</b> you keep the https:// in the description for the link</p>
		
      <p>Visit the <a href="https://github.com/BlueBots/url/issues">GitHub issues page</a> for this project and click on the "New issue" button to create a new issue. Set the title of the issue to your chosen path and add the destination URL in the description. Then, click "Submit new issue" to create the issue.</p>
		
	  <p>You will need a github account for this step!</p>
		
      <h2>Step 3: Test Your Redirect Link</h2>

      <p>After creating the issue on GitHub, wait about 5 seconds to allow the system to update. Then, you can test your redirect link by visiting <code>https://url.blueboy.cf/your-chosen-path</code> in a web browser. It should automatically redirect you to the destination URL you specified in the issue description.</p>

      <p>Congratulations! You have successfully created your own redirect link.</p>
		
	  <p>If your link redirects to a different URL, makes sure the issue title has not been taken by anyone else.</p>

      <p>If you encounter any other issues or need further assistance, feel free to <a href="url@blueboy.cf">contact me</a>.</p>
		
	  <h1>Modifying your Redirect link</h1>
		
		 <h2>Step 1: Find your issue</h2>
		
		<p>Go to the GitHub repository's issues page where you created the issue for your redirect link.</p>
		
		<p>Locate the issue with the title corresponding to your redirect link's path and open it by clicking on it</p>
		
		 <h2>Step 2: Editing the title</h2>
		
		<p>At the top-right corner of the issue page, you should see an "edit" button. Click on it.</p>
		
		<p>Change the title to whatever you want. Make sure to choose a path that is easy to remember and relates to the destination you want to redirect to.</p>
		
		<p>Click save and wait a few moments and then your new redirect should be in effect, removing your previous one.</p>
		
		 <h2>Step 3: Editing the URL</h2>
		
		<p>After clicking on your issue, you should see your previous link in a text box, on the top right of the text box is 3 dots, click them.</p>
		
		<p>After that click the edit button, remove your old link, and put your new link in. Click save and your redirect should be updated within a few seconds and your old one being removed.</p>
		
		<p>Remember to keep the https:// in your link!</p>
		
		<h2>Step 4: Removing your redirect link</h2>
		
		<p>Towards the bottom of the page your should see a purple button saying close issue, click it.</p>
		
		<p>After clicking it, your redirect should no longer work, however your issue on github can still be accessed.</p>
